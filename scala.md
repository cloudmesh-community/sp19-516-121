# Scala for Cloud Computing :o: :question:

Scala is a multi-paradigm programming language aiming to integrate the features
 of object oriented paradigm with that of functional programing. Scala is a statically typed 
 language. Scala and Java are interoprable in the sense that libraries written
  in either language can be used in Scala or Java.
  
## Language

### Install Scala

On macOS you can use Homebrew as follows:

```bash
brew update
brew install scala
```

For instructions on how to install Scala on other platforms please
vist the Scala website at https://www.scala-lang.org/download/.

### Hello World! in Scala

Open a terminal and run Scala:

```bash
scala
``` 

If Scala is installed on your machine you should get the following message:

```bash
Welcome to Scala 2.12.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 11.0.2).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala>

```
 
Now you can write and execute codes, for example:

```bash
println("hello world from scala!")
```
